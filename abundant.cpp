/********************************************************
 * CS 103 PA 1: Abundant numbers
 * Name: Brian Tinsley
 * USC email: btinsley@USC.edu
 * Comments (you want us to know):
 *
 * Description:
 *   Displays the top 3 most "abundant" (see writeup)
 *   numbers in the input sequence.  The input sequence
 *   is assumed to be valid natural numbers separated
 *   by spaces and ending with 0.
 *
 *   ABSOLUTELY NO ARRAY or `string`/`vector`/etc. usage
 *   is allowed!

 *   You may only declare: bool, int, or unsigned int
 *   No library functions (beyond cin/cout) are allowed.
 *
 *   You may NOT modify any of the given template code.
 *   This ensures our automated checkers can parse your
 *   output.  Failure to follow this direction will lead
 *   to a score of 0 on this part of the assignment.
